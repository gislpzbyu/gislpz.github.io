        <h2 class="title">Villahermosa, Tabasco</h2>
        <p>It is the capitol of the Free and Sovereign State of Tabasco, its main city, and is home to the state's largest population. The city is an important business center for the Mexican oil industry. In 2008, the city consisted of 33 colonias and fraccionamientos. Also known as La Esmeralda del Sureste (The Emerald of the Southeast), Villahermosa is a modern city rich in natural resources, in terms of both agriculture and farming. Commercially, the city is served by major merchants, such as Liverpool, F√°bricas de Fr√°ncia, Palacio de Hierro, Walmart, City Club, Soriana, Comercial Mexicana and Home Depot.

      <h3 class="title">About Villahermosa in the past</h3>
      <p>Founded officially on 24 June 1564 by the Spanish Diego de Quijada on the banks of the Grijalva River under the name of Villa Hermosa, in 1826 the village was raised to the rank of city under the name of San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa (Saint John the Baptist). During the French intervention in Mexico, French troops occupied the city in 1863. In 1916, the governor of Tabasco, Francisco J. M√∫gica, ordered the restoration of the city's name to Villahermosa.[5]

        Today, Villahermosa is a modern city and one of the most important commercial points in the long stretch of territory between Mexico City and Canc√∫n‚Äîperhaps second only to M√©rida in Yucat√°n.

              The most stunning season of the year is spring, as the flamboy√°n, guayac√°n, macuilis, and other tropical vegetation bloom and dress the city with a beautiful sense of joy along its major thoroughfares.
